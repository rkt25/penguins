## Data
This is data on 3 different species of penguins.
![](culmen_depth.png)




## Single trait distribution
The lowest bill length is around 0.01 and the highest is around 0.07.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, fill=species), alpha=0.5)

```


```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y=species), alpha=0.5)

```

```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, fill=species))+
  facet_wrap(~species, nrow=3)
```


## Relationship between multiple traits
Flipper length seems to be increasing with bodymass.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```
  

  ## Sexual dimorphism
  Male seem to have greater bill depth
  
```{r}
  penguins %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, color=sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

```


```{r}
  penguins %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()

```
